# mynoobcodes

The codes here will be mostly Hello World in nature,mostly C, C++ and Python.This repo is just for personal tracking for the #100daysnoob challenge that I started.
I will keep my progress updated with the _logR1_ file for the first 100 days forked from _Arronk's freecodecamp's 100day challenge_ official repo.
I will be learning OOP in C++ and just bits and pieces of C and some frontend web dev for the time being from any useful resources I get my hands on,though a worthy meantion would be the book *Balaguruswamy OOP with C++ By Balagurusamy *


The daily progress can also be tracked at my website [ankeshbharti.me](ankeshbharti.me).
