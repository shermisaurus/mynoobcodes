/*<side-or-corner>
The position of the gradient line's starting point. 
If specified, it consists of the word to and up to two keywords: one indicates the horizontal side (left or right), and the other the vertical side (top or bottom). The order of the side keywords does not matter. 
If unspecified, it defaults to to bottom.*/

/*If the angle is omitted, it defaults to to bottom (which is 180deg or 0.5turn):*/
